# Strategy-Based-Game
Strategy Based Game made on Unity3D Engine

This is just simple game with strategy elemnts. In this source files you may find some useful scripts like: snap object to the grid, grid object placement, smooth camera movement for mobile devices and PC, etc. Also, I would like to mention that this project was created just in 3.5 day and has pretty big **todo list**.
Here is some gifs from this game:
